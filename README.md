## Why I made this project
I made this project for Hack Club's Athena Award! For the first time, I used JavaScript and practiced using functions, loops, and using more CSS! 

## What it does
My website takes input from the user of any sequence ranging from the C major scale in the text input, input to change color with the color palette, different types of waves, and change of the volume. This will result in a unique output for every wave!
Plus, users are able to record their sine and download it through the record button on my website.

##How I made this
I made this with the Hack Club's ocsillart tutorial. Throughout the process, we used basic web development languages such as Html, Css, and JavaScript. 
Plus, I used VSCode and Github to look and code! I added a lot of pink because its one of my favorite colors. 

##Struggles
I have never really used JavaScript, so it was a huge learning curve for me (and still is because I don't totally understand all of it but its okay!) I also had to look up a lot of CSS documentation because it has been a long time since I used it. 
Plus, sometimes I found that some lines of code offered in the tutorial didn't specify where to put the lines.. so I had to guess and stare at my code which isn't really documented into my hours but I took a lot time just looking.
